# spsim

simulate single particle images from MD trajectories using PARAKEET by James Parkhurst.

## Set Up Using Pypi

Baskerville is reported to not have conda. Therefore doing setup via pypi (pip). Updating to include a first time setup script for python and pip dependencies, then updating parakeet_scarf_setup.py as a local parakeet installation script instead of a scarf installation script.

Python installation script: python_local_setup.sh
Local installation script: parakeet_local_setup.sh
